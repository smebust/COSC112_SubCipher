# COSC112_SubCipher
Substitution cipher implementation. Some method headers and code structure prewritten by Prof. Scott Kaplan.

This project was created November 2016.

This project functions as a Caesar cipher or a substitution cipher, depending on input commands. Run Crypt.java from the terminal to see the order of input parameters. Use "< >" notation in the terminal line to specify input and output files.
